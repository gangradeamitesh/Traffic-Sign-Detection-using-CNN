# Traffic-Sign-Detection-using-CNN

This is project 2 of Term 1 of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

Traffic signs are an integral part of our road infrastructure. They provide critical information, sometimes compelling recommendations, for road users, which in turn requires them to adjust their driving behaviour to make sure they adhere with whatever road regulation currently enforced. Without such useful signs, we would most likely be faced with more accidents, as drivers would not be given critical feedback on how fast they could safely go, or informed about road works, sharp turn, or school crossings ahead. In our modern age, around 1.3M people die on roads each year. This number would be much higher without our road signs.
Naturally, autonomous vehicles must also abide by road legislation and therefore recognize and understand traffic signs.

### The dataset is plit into training, test and validation sets, with the following characteristics:
Images are 32 (width) x 32 (height) x 3 (RGB color channels)

Training set is composed of 34799 images

Validation set is composed of 4410 images

Test set is composed of 12630 images

There are 43 classes (e.g. Speed Limit 20km/h, No entry, Bumpy road, etc.)
