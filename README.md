# Traffic-Sign-Detection-using-CNN

This is project 2 of Term 1 of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

Traffic sign classification is important task for self-driving cars.I have implemented Traffic sign classification using CNN.
Got Traning Accuracy around 98% and Validation Data accuracy around 93%.The model works really good.

### The dataset is plit into training, test and validation sets, with the following characteristics:
Images are 32 (width) x 32 (height) x 3 (RGB color channels)

Training set is composed of 34799 images

Validation set is composed of 4410 images

Test set is composed of 12630 images

There are 43 classes (e.g. Speed Limit 20km/h, No entry, Bumpy road, etc.)
